                    in the machine at that time

Check for resources : if there is not enough something when the user asks 
                        for that drink the machine prints that it cant
                        be done because of the low quantities of something
                        ask again for what to make

    Calculate how much money the use inserts and if is not enough refound 
        it. if is enough proceed with the order
            Give change if there is too much money inserted 

When we make a coffee change the amount of resources there are in the machine 
     at that time and
